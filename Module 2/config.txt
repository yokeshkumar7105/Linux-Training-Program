When developing applications, developers often use localhost to test their software in a local environment. The localhost address allows services to run without exposing them to the internet. For example, a web server running on localhost can be accessed safely during development. Debugging issues on localhost is faster because network latency is minimal. Once testing on localhost is complete, the application can be deployed to a production server.
